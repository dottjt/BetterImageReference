# Better Image Reference

My very first serious Elixir / Phoenix Framework project!

The idea was to create an image reference platform. I was quite passionate about drawing at the time, and wanted to create a platform where you could reference images in various ways.

While quite a lot of it was built, I ended up coming up with a potentially profitable idea for a platform (Awful CMS) so I ended up ceasing all work on this. 

In retrospective, it was probably more of a learning experience than anything. But learn I did!
